        <h3>Lord Vishnu Story</h3>
        <p>Lord Vishnu was there even when nothing was there. Thereafter, Lord Vishnu created Lord Brahma from his navel
            and Lord Brahma created the universe, which we know as the “Brahmanda”. However, until now, Earth is the
            only planet in the universe with the known existence of life in it. Unfortunately, until now, the life on
            Earth has not passed in an easy going way. The history of the world is the proof of the fact that, time and
            again, there have been wrong interruptions in the smooth going path of the world by many evil people. It is
            in order to eradicate such wrong indulgences by wicked and evil people that Lord Vishnu, the “palanhar” i.e.
            the maintainer of the world, has taken different incarnations in the world until now.</p>
        <p>Lord Vishnu is famously known as the preserver of the Universe.</p>
        <p>Vishnu essentially means one who pervades and is everything. He is also the power behind which everything
            exists. Being one of the triumvirates along with Lord Brahma, the Creator, Lord Shiva, the destroyer, Lord
            Vishnu represents Sattvaguna that is the centripetal force. He is responsible for sustenance, protection,
            and maintenance of the cosmos. Therefore, the existence of the Universe is actively maintained and
            manifested through his will.</p>

        <p>Since the beginning of time, <strong>Lord Vishnu</strong> has taken many shapes and forms to empower the good
            and to destroy evil, thereby restoring Dharma and relieving the burdens of the earth. In the Mahabharata, he
            is depicted as Narayan, tells Narada that he will appear in ten different incarnations. He appeared in the
            form of a swan (Hamsa), a tortoise (Kurma), a fish (Matsya), as a boar, (Varaha), then as a Man-lion
            (Nrisingha), then as a dwarf [Vamana], then as Rama, the son of Dasharatha, then as Krishna the scion of the
            Sattwata race, and lastly as Kalki.</p>

        <h3>The 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu known as the Dashavatara (Sanskrit: दशावतार, daśāvatāra) </h3>

        <h3>The portrayal of Lord Vishnu:</h3>
        <p>His human form is depicted with four arms, each representing a quality that is, duty and virtue, wealth and
            success, pleasure, and liberation. Lord Vishnu is usually portrayed in hues of blue, ones that resemble the
            colors of the sky, denoting his cosmic powers and connection with the gods of rain and his deeply rooted
            relationship with the earth. He is shown in a standing or a resting position wearing a necklace made of the
            Kausubha gem that rests on the left side of his chest and a garland of flowers called Vaijayanti. He is
            accompanied by his consort Goddess Lakshmi who is the goddess of wealth and creativity. Lord Vishnu resides
            in the milky waters of Vaikuntha on a bed made of the coils of the famous one thousand-headed serpent,
            Adishesha. Symbolically speaking, the ocean stands for bliss and consciousness, Adishesha, in Sanskrit means
            'that which remains' therefore symbolizing energy in Hinduism. Goddess Lakshmi, symbolizes wealth, fertility
            power and beauty. Lord Vishnu rides on Garuda, who is the King of Birds.</p>

        <h3>Restoration of the Divine</h3>
        <p>
            <em>Lord Vishnu</em> has incarnated on the earth from time to time to eradicate the evil forces and to
            restore the peace, order and Dharma and also to liberate the worthy devotees from the cycle of births and
            deaths. <em>Krishna</em>, full avatar of <strong>Lord Vishnu </strong> mentions in the <em>Bhagavad
                Gita</em>:
        </p>

        <p class="blockquote">“To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the
            principles of religion, I manifest myself, millennium after millennium.”</p>

        <!-- <div>Mentioned above is only the brief story about the ten main incarnations of Lord Vishnu. The detailed story about all the twenty-four incarnations of Lord Vishnu would be much longer than the above information. However, after knowing the above information, one can surely come to know that Lord Vishnu has faithfully performed his duty as the protector of the world by taking different incarnations and implementing right actions in those incarnations for the well-being of humanity.</div> -->

        <img class="img-fluid dharma" src="vishnudharma.jpg" alt="">

        <p>Lord Vishnu in his full avatar as Krishna has announced the general principle governing His entry into the
            world in the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 4, Shloka 7-8: “Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious
            practice, and a predominant rise of irreligion-at that time I descend. To deliver the pious and to
            annihilate the miscreants, as well as to re-establish the principles of righteousness, I Myself appear,
            millennium after millennium.”</p>

                <h3>Conclusion....but yet not the end</h3>
                <p>It can be concluded that Lord Vishnu has remained true to His words by taking different incarnations
                    in different ages to save the world from going into wrong hands and to make only truth and
                    righteousness win in every age. This is the reason, why Lord Vishnu is considered to be the real
                    hero, protector and saviour of the world. Moreover, it is also said that Lord Vishnu will be there
                    even when nothing will be there. This fact does truly summarize the quote <mark>“Hari anant, Hari
                        katha ananta”</mark> meaning the span of Lord Vishnu is endless and the stories of Lord Vishnu
                    are also endless.</p>
